CRUD API Project

Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of a basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) API using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. The project is designed to handle user data and provides endpoints to create, retrieve, update, and delete users in a MongoDB database. It also incorporates best practices for error handling and middleware usage.

Features

Create User: Add a new user to the database.

Read Users: Fetch a list of all users or specific user details.

Update User: Modify existing user data.

Delete User: Remove a user from the database.

Database Integration: Connects to a MongoDB database using Mongoose.

Environment Configuration: Supports environment variables using dotenv.

Middleware:

express.json() for parsing JSON bodies.

cors for enabling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.
